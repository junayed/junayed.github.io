From an enterprise strategy perspective, RAG still plays a critical role in achieving more deterministic performance—more so than ad-hoc prompt versioning. While AI tools deliver outsized gains, consistent business outcomes need a deliberate, data-centric retrieval strategy.",

  <p>
    There’s debate about whether RAG will “still be a thing.” What matters more is the
    clarity of your data and the retrieval choices you make. For enterprises aiming for
    reliable, auditable outcomes, RAG remains strategically important to push models
    toward deterministic behavior—far more robust than relying on prompt tweaks alone.
